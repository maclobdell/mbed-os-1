tests fail on this PR, which branches off of master from 1 month ago.  

either the PR commits introduced the problems, or the problems exist at the base of the PR, which is old.

to test -

option 1 - check out the base of the PR and retest.  

option 2 - rebase the changes onto master and retest.  ** this is probably better.

    - done.  a lot of failures.  must be related to heap or stack sizes.
